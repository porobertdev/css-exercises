   SOLUTION: Chaining both class selectors.

   This makes text smaller because the rule has higher specificity
   than the rule with `.para` selector.

   Other possible solutions:
   - chaining selector `p.small-para` for higher specificity
   - changing the order of the rules, by putting the rule with
     `.para` selector BEFORE the `.small-para` one.
     It works because it has the same specificity level with `.para`,
     thus, the Rule Order factor would apply.

/*
  SOLUTION: Use ID selector, which has higher specificity than class selector.


  Other possible solutions:
  - using chaining selector to chain the two class attributes of the button,
    `.button.confirm`, which would have higher specificity than one class
    selector (`.button` rule, which targets both button elements).
  - Change the order which would work because of the Rule Order factor, since
  two different rules with one class have the same specificity level

/*
  SOLUTION: remove the `div` selector from `div.text` chaining selector, and
            reverse the order of the rules (rule with `.child` being the last)

  This makes both rules have the same specificity level, and the Rule Order
  factor will apply. So, the conflicting declarations from the less specific rule
  won't get applied, because has lower specificity level.

  Could also just chain `div` selector with `.child` selector, to make them equal
  in specificity level, and Rule Order would still apply after reversing the order.


  Other possible solutions:
  - make `.child` rule with higher specificity, by adding more selectors using
    the chaining selector:
      - div.text.child
      -.text.child
